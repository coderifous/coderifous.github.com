What a long time coming this blog has been.  I've been meaning to get this blog
up for EVER.  Well, ladies and gents, great things come to those who wait.

Before moving on, let's take a moment to notice some of the finer accoutrements
that this blog has to offer:

* Disqus Comments: Any comment is a great comment with Disqus Comments.
* The freshest Github projects streamed via the Github API.
* Recent Tweets: No modern blog would be complete without twitter integration.
* A foundation you can depend on: [jeckyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) based, and
  hosted using Github Pages
* An author of the witty and handsome variety.

So that should take care of the Obligatory First Post.  Thanks for reading, and
I look forward to the fame and fortune that are sure to follow.
