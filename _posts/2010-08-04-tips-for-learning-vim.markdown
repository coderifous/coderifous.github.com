Yehuda recently wrote about his [trials in trying to switch to Vim](http://yehudakatz.com/2010/07/29/everyone-who-tried-to-convince-me-to-use-vim-was-wrong/), the failed approaches, and what finally did work for him.  I thought this was great, because different people learn in different ways, and the unique approach someone else comes up with might work well for you too.  In that spirit, I wanted to share a few methods I used while learning Vim that worked well for me.

Separated into their own posts for digestibility, and in no particular order...

* [Switching from the arrows to `hjkl`](switching-from-arrows-to-hjkl.html)
* [Remap Caps Lock to Control](remap-caps-lock-to-control.html)
* [Don't start from scratch](dont-start-from-scratch.html)

### Don't forget the built in help!

Vim has a ridiculously useful help system built in.  This may seem obvious, but I always forget this fact and rush off to google to figure something out, and the search will regularly lead me back to the Vim docs.

{% highlight sh %}
  :help
{% endhighlight %}

### Vim links

Here's a few resources that helped me along:

* [Learning vi and Vim](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Vim-Editors-Arnold-Robbins/dp/059652983X) O'Reilly book
* [Daily Vim tips](http://dailyvim.blogspot.com/)
* [Best Vim Tips on vim.wikia.com](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Best_Vim_Tips)

I highly recommend the O'Reilly book.  It's big, but it's a worthwhile investment if you're going to make Vim your One True Editor.
