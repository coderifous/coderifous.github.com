  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
  I'm Jim Garvin, (aka <a href="http://twitter.com/coderifous">Coderifous</a>) and this is my blog where I write about stuff that
    interests me.  You'll find geeky stuff, entrepreneurial stuff, sciencey stuff, and
    some life-in-general stuff.
  </p>
  <p>I'm a software engineer by trade, but don't let that fool you.</p>
  <p><em>I'm an Idea Producer</em>.<br />Software is my medium.</p>
